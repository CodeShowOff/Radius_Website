            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome to Radius. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent 
              about how we handle your data. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, 
              how we use it, and your rights regarding your personal data.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Privacy is fundamental to Radius.</strong> Unlike traditional social apps, we 
              don't track your location via GPS, we don't sell your data, and we minimize data 
              collection wherever possible.

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Information You Provide</h3>
            <ul className="highlight-list">
              <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Email address, display name, profile photo, bio, and date of birth (to verify age requirements)</li>
              <li><strong>Profile Data:</strong> Gender, interests, and other optional profile fields you choose to share</li>
              <li><strong>User Content:</strong> Messages, photos, voice recordings, and other content you share through the app</li>
              <li><strong>Authentication Data:</strong> If you sign in with Google or Apple, we receive basic profile information from those providers</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Automatically Collected Information</h3>
            <ul className="highlight-list">
              <li><strong>Bluetooth Proximity Data:</strong> Signal strength and proximity information from nearby Radius users (this is NOT GPS location)</li>
              <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device model, operating system, app version, unique device identifiers</li>
              <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Features you use, time spent in app, interaction patterns (to improve the app experience)</li>
              <li><strong>Push Notification Tokens:</strong> Device tokens to send you notifications (stored securely in Firebase)</li>
              <li><strong>Location Data (Nearby Help Only):</strong> GPS coordinates are collected ONLY for the Nearby Help (SOS) feature when you save home/work locations or request/offer emergency assistance</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Information We DO NOT Collect for General Use</h3>
            <ul className="x-list">
              <li><strong>GPS Location Tracking:</strong> We don't track your GPS coordinates for proximity discovery or general app use</li>
              <li><strong>Location History:</strong> We don't maintain a history of where you've been (except saved locations for Nearby Help)</li>
              <li><strong>Contacts Access:</strong> We don't access or upload your device contacts</li>
              <li><strong>Browsing History:</strong> We don't track your activity outside the app</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div className="info-box">
              <p><strong>Important Note on Location:</strong> Radius uses Bluetooth technology for proximity discovery — NOT GPS. 
              The only feature that uses GPS location is Nearby Help (SOS) for emergency assistance, and this is entirely optional. 
              You can use all other Radius features without ever enabling location permissions.</p>

            <h3>With Other Users</h3>
            <p>
              Your public profile (name, photo, bio, interests) is visible to other authenticated 
              Radius users. Your proximity status is only visible to nearby users when you're 
              actively using the app. Messages and content are shared with users you're connected with.
            </p>

            <h3>With Service Providers</h3>
            <p>We share necessary data with trusted service providers who help us operate Radius:</p>

            </ul>
            <p>
              These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and only use it 
              for specified purposes.
            </p>

            <h3>We DO NOT Sell Your Data</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Radius does not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties 
              for marketing purposes. Ever.</strong>
            </p>

            <h3>Legal Requirements</h3>
            <p>
              We may disclose information if required by law, court order, or to protect the rights, 
              safety, and security of Radius, our users, or others.
