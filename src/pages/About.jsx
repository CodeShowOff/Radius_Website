          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Radius was born from a simple observation: despite living in an increasingly connected world, 
            genuine human connections have become rare. We're surrounded by people yet more isolated than ever. 
            Traditional social apps focus on followers, likes, and curated personas — not real relationships.
          </p>
          <p>
            We asked ourselves: what if technology could help us connect with the people who are actually around us? 
            What if your phone could be a bridge to real-world connections instead of a barrier? What if privacy 
            wasn't sacrificed for connectivity?
          </p>
          <p>
            That's how Radius was created — a social discovery app that uses Bluetooth technology to help you 
            discover and connect with people in your immediate vicinity, all while respecting your privacy.

              <p>
                Your data is yours. We use Bluetooth for proximity discovery — no GPS tracking. 
                Location is only used for the Nearby Help (SOS) feature for emergency assistance. 
                We don't sell your information or monitor your activity.

              <p>

          <h2>How Radius Works</h2>
          <p>
            Radius uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to detect nearby users without requiring 
            GPS or internet connectivity. When you open the app, it scans for other Radius users within 
            Bluetooth range and displays them based on signal strength — showing who's close, nearby, or 
            at the edge of your radius.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can send connection requests to users you're interested in connecting with. Once both 
            parties accept, you can start chatting, join groups together, or explore various features 
            designed to make meeting new people enjoyable and natural.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond one-on-one connections, Radius offers location-based groups for your city, 
            topic-based global communities, and even temporary Bluetooth groups for spontaneous meetups.
